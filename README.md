## Why share on GitHub?
I use this lightweight FPS template for my First Person Shooter projects. It's not hard to implement but its nice to have a lightweight quickstart.

## Credit
This project is based on the repo https://github.com/tomlooman/SimpleFPSTemplate.
I've decided to expand upon this project for my projects, like crouching, teleporting, reload system etc.

## ⚠️ Warning
This is my first public C++ project, feel free to give feedback or suggestions for improvements!
