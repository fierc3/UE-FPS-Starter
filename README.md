## Feature List
- 3D Revolver with muzzle effects, continuous projectile shooting and animations.
- SOLID approach to implementation in both C++ classes and Blueprints.
- Focus on making C++ code the core and then use more "visual/frontend" work to be done in Blueprints.
- Ability system with Select Screen (including 2 example abilities).
- Player character with movement, including a dash.
- "Juicy" effects that make the usage feel better for the player, like camera shake, hitmakers, shaders and sounds.
- Hit detection with decal and blood visuals.
- Simple Crosshair implementation
- Test map and test enemies with health and death particle effects.
- Miscellaneous add-ons that make working in UE5 a bit more efficient like a global event bus system and log helper.
- Example gitignore and gitattributes files for UE5.
- More and more features are being developed as Problemsome makes more games.


## Credit
This project is based on the repo https://github.com/tomlooman/SimpleFPSTemplate.
A lot has been added to it, including many basic features needed for most FPS games. It’s primarily designed for future Problemsome indie game development.

I attempted only to use cc0-licensed assets for 3d meshes and audio.

## ⚠️ Warning
This is my first commercial and public C++ project, feel free to give feedback or suggestions for improvements!
